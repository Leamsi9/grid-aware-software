## TL;DR / Executive Summary

1. **The core concept of shifting compute jobs to respond to the grid is a smart one.** But there are only small-to-zero carbon reduction benefits from implementing most current carbon-aware time-shifting and location-shifting computing approaches, and some unacknowledged dangers. 

2. **If such approaches are adopted at scale without implementation constraints, they are likely to increase emissions and destabilise electricity grid systems.** This does not improve the tech industry’s contributions to global sustainability, but rather worsens them. It also risks becoming, or is already, a greenwashing effort.

3. **The key failure in current carbon aware computing is the lack of any "warning labels".** It's helpful to explore and even promote carbon-aware computing, but irreponsible to do so without forethought around potential risks and explicit caveats such as
    -  **Running compute jobs at a time and place when the electricity grid energy mix happens to be greener is not enough to achieve _actual_ carbon reductions from that computing operation.**  It aso needs to run when demand is low; target stable electricity grids; and verifiably use curtailed electricity or run on genuinely additive renewable electricity.

    - **Achieving carbon reductions of particular computing jobs is pointless if it does not reduce the net electricity demand of our computing as a whole.**  Because renewable energy can only power less than 13% of global energy demand, if our compute's energy demand grows in a year, even 100% effective carbon aware computing on the electricity grid will mean a net increase in our emissions. 

4. **True carbon-aware computing should ask not just how green is our use of the electricity grid for any given job at any given time, but on how responsible is our use of the electricity grid as a whole.** For now we’re calling this more mature, holistic and nuanced approach **_‘grid-aware computing’_.**

## Context/about 

The body of work presented here, started after Ismael posted some questions and research into the <a href="https://climateaction.tech/community/">CAT's Slack</a>. Hannah, amongst many others picked up on the discussion. 

Following some debate on the issue, Hannah and Ismael agreed to work together to further develop the research on the problems with carbon-aware and ultimately come up with this presentation of the issues.

If it were not for <a href="https://cliamteaction.tech">CAT</a> this work would not have come to fruition on this way - thank you CAT for bringing people together!
