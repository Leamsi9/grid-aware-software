## TL;DR / Executive Summary

1. The core concept of shifting compute jobs to respond to the grid is a smart one. But we need to usher in the next, more mature and nuanced version which we’re calling ‘grid-aware computing’.

2. There are only small-to-zero carbon reduction benefits from implementing most current carbon-aware time-shifting and location-shifting computing approaches, while adding significant risks of unintended destructive effects. 

3. If such approaches are adopted at scale without implementation constraints, they are likely to increase emissions and destabilise electricity grid systems. This does not improve the tech industry’s contributions to global sustainability, but rather worsens them. It also risks becoming, or is already, a greenwashing effort and little more.

4. The key failure is never mentioning that "terms and conditions apply". Carbon-aware computing that can yield actual carbon reductions is: 
	- Running when demand is low using curtailed electricity in stable grids, or;
	- Running on genuinely additive renewable electricity.

5. If we really want to make computing more sustainable, the central, dominant question is “is your compute’s net electricity demand reducing?”. Finding ways to limit the growth of computing is a far more effective way to contribute to lowering emissions than optimisation.

## Context/about 

The body of work presented here, started after Ismael posted some questions and research into the <a href="https://climateaction.tech/community/">CAT's Slack</a>. Hannah, amongst many others picked up on the discussion. 

Following debate, Hannah and Ismael agreed to work together to further develop the research on the problems with carbon-aware and ultimately come up with the outline of a proposal to improve it. 

If it were not for <a href="https://cliamteaction.tech">CAT</a> this work would not have come to fruition on this way - thank you CAT for bringing people together!
