# 7. What can you do to help?

Big Tech is listening to us, and this is an inflection point right now.

We have the opportunity and responsibility to shape corporate discourse and action around carbon-aware computing in a responsible direction that will reduce emissions in a noticeable way. 

You can do this by:
- Sharing this content with practitioners of carbon-aware approaches to educate and inform - please be mindful of [our license](README.md#license);
- Contribute to this content through raising issues or suggesting edits in <a href="https://github.com/climateaction-tech/grid-aware-software">our github repo</a>;
- Communicating the ideas and issues presented in this post to your work community and relevant stakeholders and networks;
- Conducting further research and case-studies into the dangers, mitigations and improvements of current carbon-aware approaches and sharing those; and
- Building upon the initial concepts of grid-aware software through research, prototypes, case studies, or feedback;

**The choice is yours. The time is now.**
