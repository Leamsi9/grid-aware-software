# When does carbon-aware software make sense?

Let’s be absolutely clear on the answer to the question “is carbon-aware computing just bad?” No. We don’t intend to bash the core concepts of carbon-aware software. 

The core concept that shifting compute jobs to respond to the electricity available is sound. 

**The criticism, however, is that current approaches never mention that "terms and conditions apply".**

There is no real acknowledgement of the nuances, nor of how balancing supply and demand works in practice. We fail to mention that the current patterns are only helpful in certain circumstances, futile in most, and seriously harmful in others. We also fail to mention that making our code use electricity more efficiently is not enough to make the carbon emission reductions needed by the tech sector.

Unless the widely adopted approaches become more sophisticated and work in sync with how the grid is actually managed in reality, we don’t stand to gain much. 

It seems the uncomfortable outcome is all this effort is hampering tech’s sustainability efforts as we try to help them. The damage of runaway climate change to populations around the world demands that we do better, and we believe the tech sector is <a href="https://rtl.chrisadams.me.uk/2023/07/comparing-what-is-spent-on-share-buybacks-vs-the-cost-of-decarbonising-the-grid/">well resourced enough to tackle this in a meaningful way</a>.



THERE STILL A LOT TO ADD HERE FROM THE ORIGINAL DOC - AM WORKING ON IT!!
