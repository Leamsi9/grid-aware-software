# Appendix 1 - Innovation with distributed alternatives

Hyperscale computing today is highly centralised in massive data centres. To power such enormous compute directly requires renewable generation facilities taking up massive amounts of land and water, around already huge data centre land occupation. While this can genuinely reduce compute emissions from hyperscalers, there are usually wider environmental, social and economic impacts, aside from the logistics involved. 

As an example, one such project is <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/230-million-solar-powered-data-center-planned-in-aragon-spain/">underway in Zaragoza, Spain</a>. A 40,000 square metres data centre will be supplied by two solar farms. Just one of these two solar farms, accounting for 90MW,  will span <a href="https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2023-1169">232 gross hectares</a> (2.3m square metres). This is roughly the size of Central Park in New York. It will take up land rich in biodiversity, which, provisions notwithstanding, it seems set to damage, including endangered species of both animals and trees.

And one more, the recent data centre built by Google in Chile is double the size, <a href="https://www.ciperchile.cl/2020/05/25/las-zonas-oscuras-de-la-evaluacion-ambiental-que-autorizo-a-ciegas-el-megaproyecto-de-google-en-cerrillos/">extracting 169 litres of water/second in the local area</a> and would thus require close to 10 million square metres to be powered directly by solar.

Local populations are already feeling the impact from the huge expansion of data centres. There’s a movement forming calling for a <a href="https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/inside-the-data-centre-moratorium-movement">moratorium on data centre construction</a>. It’s happening globally – in <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/dublin/2022/0110/1272869-eirgrid-datacentres-dublin/">Ireland</a>, <A href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/05/28/meta-data-center-zeewolde-netherlands/">The Netherlands</a>, and <a href="https://www.itpro.com/server-storage/data-centres/367441/why-singapore-stopped-building-data-centres">Singapore</a>. The resistance is not just around electricity consumption. <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2022/11/02/big-techs-new-headache-data-centre-activism-flourishes-across-the-world/">Water use is a huge issue too</a>. Local populations in <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/news/local/facebook-data-center-water-use-scrutinized/article_521c48ac-c971-577c-bed2-3b0c7df4b0cc.html">New Mexico, USA</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center">Uruguay</a>, and <a href="https://www.ciperchile.cl/2020/05/25/las-zonas-oscuras-de-la-evaluacion-ambiental-que-autorizo-a-ciegas-el-megaproyecto-de-google-en-cerrillos/">Chile</a> continue to be at the forefront of the struggle over resource use.

**However, hyperscale is not the only model, and it doesn’t have to be the inevitable future**.

## Distributed computing

Most computing today is highly distributed or distributable. There are <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02428">experiments with co-location of compute</a> (crypto-currency specifically) where renewable generation already exists. This ensures direct power for compute using renewable energy, and plays a role in renewable electricity demand management. This too has the risk for perverse incentives effects. But with the right guardrails could be a significant paradigm to expand and explore.

There are a number of examples of having different form factors for generation than a giant, warehouse scale computer. <a href="https://david-sykes.medium.com/the-energy-onion-a-simple-conceptual-model-for-a-smart-system-3c1f2c5cbd1a">The energy onion</a> by David Sykes of Octopus Energy, presents a way of thinking about energy that centres variable renewable energy and efficiency.

You can also argue that it's possible to have the convenience of cloud computing without the need to have hyperscale data centres too. Companies like <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">Oxide</a>, with their cloud computer are all about making the things we associate with cloud providers (ease of use), and making them available without the massive buildings. Another example, <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/carbon-neutral-ai-inferencing">serverless companies experimenting with Deep Green datacentres</a>.


## Distributed electricity generation

Finally mainstream electricity generation tends to be concentrated in massive power plants. Renewable electricity infrastructure makes distributed energy generation possible. Instead of electricity being generated in a few massive central nodes, significant amounts could be generated in a large number of widely distributed, smaller nodes and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211830128X#bbib113">microgrids</a>. 

The idea of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anaza-Sikiru-2/publication/368472105_Potential_of_Renewable_Energy_Sources_for_Distributed_Generations_An_Overview/links/63efa2f919130a1a4a896a9c/Potential-of-Renewable-Energy-Sources-for-Distributed-Generations-An-Overview.pdf">matching distributed renewable energy generation</a> with distributed computing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jcde/qwac087">has been floated</a> and holds promise. This not only allows the off-grid powering of compute, but also expands the possibilities of dual use. For example distributed data centre servers can be used <a href="https://energycentral.com/system/files/ece/nodes/418708/200424_sdia_report_utility_full-final.pdf">simultaneously for compute and for heating</a>, reducing the energy currently spent for indoor heating.
